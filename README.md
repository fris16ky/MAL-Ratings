# Overview
This is a simple, fun, and functional project that I wanted to do stemming from my love of Webscrapers. I watch a decent amount of anime, so I want to be able to track certain aspects (I love statistics). 
This code parses a website that I constantly update (whenever I finish an episode), grabs the names of the show and the ratings (which I also went through and rated everything for this project). Due to how the data is stored on the website, the ratings are per SEASON of
an Anime rather than the show as a whole. The final code goes through the dictionary and returns the animes sorted alphabetically and by rating, and also gives a final count of how many are in each rating (i.e. 5 rated 1/10, 20 rated 9/10). 

# Technology
This code uses Python, BeautifulSoup 4, Selenium, and UnicodeData; the data is stored in dictionaries.
